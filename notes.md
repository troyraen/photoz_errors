# Questions


# To Do:

- [x] create data files with colors
- [x] run RF and NN for several sample sizes and plot
- [ ] understand/optimize NN and RF
- [ ] find k nearest neighbor
- [ ] find AdaBoostM1
- [ ] check out ANNz2

algorithms:
	* neural net
	* random forest
	* k nearest neighbor
	* XG boost (variant of decision trees) python implementation (possibly use 'AdaBoostM1' in matlab: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/423851-is-there-any-implementation-of-xgboost-algorithm-for-decision-trees-in-matlab)
	* ANNz2
	relevance vector machine
