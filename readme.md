This code tests selected machine learning algorithms on the problem of predicting photometric redshifts.

Final plots are in [data/errors_plots/](data/errors_plots/).

Code to make final plots is in [data/plot_errors.py](data/plot_errors.py).

Code to process data files is in [data/data_proc.py](data/data_proc.py).

All code that does training is in [matlab/](matlab/).

See [matlab/pipeline.md](matlab/pipeline.md) for process, testing, and more plots.
