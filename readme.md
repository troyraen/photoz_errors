This code tests selected machine learning algorithms on the problem of predicting photometric redshifts.

Final plots are in [](data/errors_plots/).

Code to make final plots is in [](data/plot_errors.py).

Code to process data files is in [](data/data_proc.py).

All code that does training is in [](matlab/).

See [](matlab/pipeline.md) for process, testing, and more plots.
